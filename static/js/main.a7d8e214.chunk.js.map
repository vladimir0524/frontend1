(I’m talking to you, HR leaders.) Not only that, these reviews must also help align employees’ goals with the organization’s broader direction, quantify who their high and low performers are, and keep engagement high. But because reviews have become so ineffective that nearly 50% of HR professionals don’t even think they’re accurate, many leaders are scrapping the formal, annual review and pivoting towards more informal, frequent review cycles. Doing this creates space for open, honest talks about wins and losses, goal alignment, and long-term development plans. Here are three benefits of instituting more frequent and consistent performance reviews.',\n          author: 'Emanuel Darlea',\n          pubDate: '28 Jan 2021',\n          commentCounts: 12,\n          voteCounts: 4,\n          link: \"https://start.azintranet.com/#/department/287/Human-resources/article/601c1391a9322b127b95a65f\"\n      },\n      {\n          category: 'Latest news',\n          featuredImage: '/images/article3.jpg',\n          title: 'TOP 10 HR TRENDS TO HELP SHAPE YOUR 2021 STRATEGY',\n          info: '(Article imported from www.humanresourcestoday.com) Last year will go down as one of the most infamous years of our lifetime.

Historically, employees have been conditioned to develop “safe” professional personas, covering up core aspects of their personalities to protect their jobs, their reputations, and their future opportunities.

Bravo. Charlie. The phonetic alphabet was adopted in 1956 to avoid confusion when spelling out words over radio and telephone. With background noise and imperfect technology, an “n” can sound like “m” and “f” can sound like “s,” but “November” is clearly not “Mike” and “Foxtrot” is clearly not “Sierra.” Sure, there might be some effort to use this approach, but the reward is precision that saves time and prevents mistakes. Managing an organization’s culture has a similar problem. We may be saying one thing, but others hear a different thing, and the results are wasted time and costly mistakes. This was one surprising discovery from the listening tour that CultureIQ has been on since last year. We asked CEOs and HR executives questions to better understand why companies often struggle with the measurement, interpretation, and development of their culture. We have come to realize that the most prevalent terms in our culture conversations are often misheard – not because their sounds are fuzzy, but because their meanings are fuzzy.
